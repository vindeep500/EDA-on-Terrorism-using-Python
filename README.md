In this project, we have a dataset of Terrorism overall the world. Our aim is to draw useful insights from the dataset for presenting to the stakeholders like security and defense analysts. 
So, first of all, we perform thorough data cleaning which icludes handling missing values, oultier detection, etc. and doing data manipulation. 
After ensuring that our data is clean and ready for analysis, we can move to the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) step. 
In the EDA, we can draw meaning insights like the top countries with most attacks, most common attacks type, which group has highest involvement in the total attacks,etc.
